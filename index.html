            <h2>Best 5v5 Moba PC game</h2>
            <p>Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map.</p>
            <p> Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play.</p>

              <p class="txt-contents">Strength heroes tend to have more health and health regeneration than other heroes, 
                  making them more resilient to both physical attacks and spells. Strength heroes have a great variety in their roles, 
                  including that of carry, ganker, and support, but almost all of them have some form of strong initiation and are supposed 
                  to act as tanks to some degree.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="txt-contents">Because Agility heroes are the only class of heroes to gain both damage and attack speed as their 
                  primary attribute increases, they tend to have the highest physical damage output as the game progresses. This makes 
                  them scale very well with offensive items. They tend to have limited disabling capabilities or nukes; almost 
                  all their abilities augment their physical capabilities or serve as positioning or escape mechanisms.</p>

              <p class="txt-contents">Intelligence heroes tend to have a greater number of active abilities compared to other heroes 
                  all intelligence heroes have at least three active abilities, with a large number of them having all four of their 
                  abilities being actives, and some even having 5 or more. Their larger mana pools and higher mana regen rates go a 
                  long way to help them use these abilities frequently.</p>
